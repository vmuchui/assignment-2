    <h1> ABOUT US </h1>
    <p> When you work with us, you are part of a committed team of collaborators.<br>All aspects of our software development process are integrated, iterative and agile. </p>
   
    <p> Our approach unifies design, development and <br> product management to create exceptional products. <br> We start each project by understanding your business goals,
        <br> the user's needs and the product requirements. <br>Then we help translate them into effective and elegant solutions. </p>
    
    <h1> SERVICES </h1>

    <p> Before we sign a contract or write a line of code our team will spend the necessary
        <br> time needed to understand your product vision. 
        <br>The outcome of this scoping session is a proposal or high-level statement of work. <br>  Based on your requirements, we can provide a complete offering or just the pieces 
        <br> you need.
